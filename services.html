            <p>Definition: <i>A form of traditional Chinese medicine in which a
                local suction is created on the skin.</i>

            <p>Cupping is a form of physical therapy that has been practiced
            for over 3,000 years. It can help draw out bad blood to dispel
            stagnation (stagnant blood and lymph) to further improve the flow
            of qi in the human body. Cupping is safe when applied by a trained
            practioner on people who are otherwise healthy, and treatment is
            generally not very painful.
            
            <p>Cupping is generally performed by placing cups on certain areas
            of the body then creating a partial vacuum (by either heating then
            cooling of the air, or with a mechanical pump). Afterwards, the
            cups are left in place for a period of time (5-15 minutes).
            

            <p>Cupping can help with:
            <ul>
                <li>Respiratory diseases (common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis)</li>
                <li>Musculoskeletal conditions (neck, shoulder, back)</li>
            </ul>

Chinese Medicine?
Chinese medicine is a medical system that has been around for over 2,500 years. It is mainly based on the concept of restoring the body's natural balance. At the root of the medicine is Qi (pronounced chee), which generally translates to "energy" in English. Qi flows along meridians that course through the body, and it is when Qi gets stagnated that diseases and disorders arise. Chinese medicine is comprised of acupuncture, herbal medicine, cupping, moxabustion, and tui na.

Acupuncture
Acupuncture is the placement of very fine, disposable, stainless steel needles at specific points in the body. The needles are used to restore the smooth flow of Qi in the body and to restore the body's natural balance. Studies have shown acupuncture to have an affect on the nervous system, muscles and organ function, as well as reducing pain, swelling, and inflammation.

Electro-Acupuncture
Electro-Acupuncture is very similar to acupuncture, except an electric stimulation machine is used to conduct tiny electric currents through the acupuncture needles. This is done for increased stimulation and stronger treatments. The technique has been proven to decrease pain, speed up the healing of tissue and reduce inflammation.

Herbal Medicine
Chinese herbal medicine consists of a combination of raw, dried herbs that are usually added to water and simmered to make a liquid decoction. It may also come in a pill or powdered form. Taken internally, Chinese herbal medicine can help the body's natural healing process and restore balance.

Tui Na
Tui Na is a type of Chinese Medicine that is a non-invasive, manipulative therapy that is akin to acupressure, massage, and physical adjustment. It is used to improve the function of the muscles, tendons, bones, joints and internal organs. Tui Na is also a commonly used technique for treating children.

Cupping
Cupping involves the placement of glass or bamboo cups over a certain part of the body to help relieve stagnation and increase circulation. It is commonly used for a range of conditions from back pain to common colds.

Moxibustion
Moxibustion is a heat therapy that involves the burning of moxa (mugwort plant) over certain parts of the body to stimulate acupuncture points, increase circulation, and/or relieve pain. It is also commonly used for turning breeched babies.
